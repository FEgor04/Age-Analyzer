To use it, you should create "settings.py" file with two variables: token, version, target.

Then, to start it print:

`python3 ageanalyzer.py`

Then, print target`s id (or short link). If it didn't work, try to print it in quotes (" ")

If target's profile age is -1, then the year of birth is not defined on target's page.
